After 4 weeks of building, we're launching gICM://SEND

The AI marketplace that cuts 92% of your tokens and ships 4x faster.

68 agents • 92 skills • 94 commands • 66 MCPs

Built for Solana builders who want to ship, not wait.

🧵👇
```

**Tweet 2** (Problem):
```
The problem: You spend hours writing prompts, managing context, and debugging AI responses.

Each Claude session costs 10K+ tokens.

You're paying $100s/month in AI costs.

And you're still slower than traditional coding.
```

**Tweet 3** (Solution):
```
gICM solves this with Progressive Disclosure:

Instead of dumping your entire codebase in each prompt (12,500 tokens)...

Load only what's needed, when it's needed (980 tokens).

Same quality. 92% less cost. 4.7x faster builds.
```

**Tweet 4** (Social Proof):
```
247 alpha keys issued
368 production-ready items
24 Solana-specific agents
12 DeFi integration tools

### Product Hunt Launch

**Tagline:**
"The AI marketplace for Web3 builders - 92% token savings, 4x faster builds"

**First Comment (Founder Story):**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Mirko, and I built gICM because I was frustrated.

Every time I wanted to build on Solana, I'd spend hours:
- Writing the same prompts over and over
- Managing massive context windows
- Debugging AI hallucinations
- Paying hundreds in AI costs

And I was STILL slower than just coding manually.

So I asked: "What if AI could be 92% cheaper AND 4x faster?"

That's gICM.

Instead of sending your entire codebase with every prompt, Progressive Disclosure loads only what's needed. Same quality, fraction of the cost.

We built:
✅ 68 specialized agents (24 for Solana)
✅ 92 progressive skills (88-92% token savings)
✅ 94 production commands
✅ 66 MCP integrations (pre-configured)
✅ 3 workflow templates (ship in weeks)

Real results:
- Solana DeFi: 2-4 weeks vs 8-12
- NFT Marketplace: 3-5 weeks vs 10-16
- Web3 SaaS: 4-6 weeks vs 12-20

We've already helped 247 alpha users save $35k-140k per project.

Today, we're opening up to everyone.

🚀 Launching gICM: The AI Marketplace for Web3 Builders

After 4 weeks of intensive development, I'm excited to announce gICM://SEND - a marketplace that makes AI-powered development 92% cheaper and 4x faster.

**The Problem:**
Web3 builders face a unique challenge. Traditional AI tools aren't optimized for blockchain development. You're sending massive codebases in every prompt, racking up token costs, and still debugging AI hallucinations.

**The Solution:**
gICM uses Progressive Disclosure technology to load only relevant context when needed. Instead of 12,500 tokens per session, you use 980. Same quality. 92% savings.

**What's Inside:**
• 68 Specialized Agents (24 for Solana)
• 92 Progressive Skills
• 94 Production Commands
• 66 MCP Integrations
• 3 Comprehensive Workflow Templates

**Real Results:**
Our 247 alpha users are building:
- DeFi protocols in 2-4 weeks (vs 8-12 traditional)
- NFT marketplaces in 3-5 weeks (vs 10-16 traditional)
- Web3 SaaS in 4-6 weeks (vs 12-20 traditional)

Savings: $35k-140k per project.

**Backed by AWS Activate:**
Graduated projects get access to up to $100k in AWS credits through our partnership program.

**Special Launch Offer:**
First 500 alpha users get:
✅ Lifetime founding member badge
✅ Priority support
✅ Early access to all premium features
✅ AWS Activate partnership benefits

Title: Built an AI marketplace that cuts Solana dev time by 4x

After spending months building DeFi protocols and watching my Claude costs skyrocket, I built gICM - an AI marketplace optimized for Solana development.

The key innovation: Progressive Disclosure. Instead of dumping your entire Anchor project in every prompt (12K+ tokens), we load only what's needed (980 tokens). 92% savings, same quality.

What's inside:
- 24 Solana-specific agents (Anchor, security audits, program development)
- 18 DeFi integration tools (Serum, Raydium, Orca)
- Pre-configured Helius RPC + Solana Agent Kit
- Production deployment templates

Real example: Built a complete AMM in 2 weeks vs 8-12 weeks traditional.

It's free during alpha. First 500 users get founding member benefits.

Happy to answer questions about the tech or Solana integration!

Title: Progressive Disclosure: How I cut AI costs by 92% without sacrificing quality

I was spending $200+/month on Claude for a single project. Every prompt sent my entire codebase. Most of that context was never used.

So I built Progressive Disclosure: AI loads context incrementally, only when needed.

Result: 92% token reduction, 4.7x faster development.

Built gICM marketplace around this:
- 68 specialized agents
- 92 progressive skills
- 94 production commands
- Real workflow templates

Free during alpha: gicm.io

**Key Sections:**

**Introduction:**
```
I was paying $200/month for Claude to build a Solana DeFi protocol.

Every prompt sent 12,500+ tokens. My entire Anchor project. All the dependencies. Complete docs. Every. Single. Time.

Most of that context was never used. I was essentially paying Claude to ignore 90% of what I sent.

Then I discovered Progressive Disclosure.

Now I pay $16/month. Same quality. 12x cheaper. And I ship 4x faster.

Here's how...
```

**Technical Section:**
```
Traditional Approach:
- Send entire codebase: 8,000 tokens
- Include all documentation: 3,200 tokens
- Add examples: 800 tokens
- Your actual question: 500 tokens
Total: 12,500 tokens per prompt

Progressive Disclosure:
- Relevant code snippet: 400 tokens
- Focused docs section: 350 tokens
- Specific example: 130 tokens
- Your question: 100 tokens
Total: 980 tokens per prompt

Savings: 91.8%

But here's the magic: The AI gets BETTER context because it's not drowning in irrelevant information.
