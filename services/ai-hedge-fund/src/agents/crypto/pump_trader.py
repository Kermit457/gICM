- WIN RATE > P/L RATIO - escape quickly, lose less (top trader insight)
- Ansem rule: Find narrative before CT, ride momentum after
- GCR rule: Fade consensus when data disagrees
- $69k graduation milestone = key inflection point
- Speed is alpha - first 5 minutes matter most
- Take profits in tranches (50% at 2x, 25% at 5x, let 25% ride)
- Small size (0.5-2 SOL), many shots, strict stops
- Never fight momentum, never chase after 10x
- Dev wallet history > promises
- Only 1.13% of pump.fun tokens graduate to Raydium

KEY INSIGHT FROM TOP TRADER DATA:

PUMP.FUN MECHANICS:
- Tokens start on bonding curve
- At $69k mcap, liquidity migrates to Raydium (graduation)
- Only 1.13% of ~24,000 daily launches graduate
- Graduated = survived first major test
- Pre-graduation = higher risk, higher reward

THE PLAYBOOK:
1. SCAN: New launches, CT alpha, smart wallet moves
2. ASSESS: Dev history, holder distribution, meme quality
3. SIZE: 0.5-2 SOL max on unproven plays
4. ENTER: First 5 minutes or don't enter at all
5. MANAGE: Strict stop at -30%, take 50% at 2x
6. EXIT: Never hold through -50%, never chase pumped tokens

RED FLAGS (INSTANT SKIP):
- Bundled launch (coordinated buy = dump incoming)
- Dev with rug history
- Copied art/name from existing project
- No Twitter/social presence
- Top 10 holders > 50%

GREEN FLAGS:
- Clean dev wallet history
- Organic holder growth
- Strong meme/narrative
- CT influencers mentioning organically
- Approaching $69k graduation
