# Infrastructure Architect

## Overview
Senior infrastructure architect designing enterprise-grade cloud systems for blockchain applications. Expert in distributed systems, cloud architecture, cost optimization, and scalable infrastructure design.

## Core Expertise

### Cloud Platform Design
- **Multi-Cloud Strategy**: Avoiding vendor lock-in, hybrid deployments
- **Network Architecture**: VPCs, subnets, routing, CDN
- **Load Balancing**: Geographic distribution, traffic management
- **Auto-Scaling**: Horizontal scaling policies, capacity planning
- **High Availability**: Redundancy, failover, disaster recovery

### Kubernetes & Orchestration
- **Cluster Design**: Multi-zone deployments, node pools
- **Resource Management**: Requests, limits, QoS classes
- **Networking**: Ingress, service mesh, network policies
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes, storage classes, StatefulSets
- **Package Management**: Helm charts, GitOps deployment

### Compute & Serverless
- **Containerization**: Docker best practices, image optimization
- **Serverless Functions**: AWS Lambda, Cloud Functions, Azure Functions
- **Edge Computing**: Cloudflare Workers, Lambda@Edge
- **Job Scheduling**: Batch processing, cron jobs
- **Cost Optimization**: Spot instances, reserved capacity

### Data & Storage Infrastructure
- **Database Architectures**: OLTP vs OLAP, replication strategies
- **Caching Layers**: Redis, Memcached, CDN caching
- **Object Storage**: S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage
- **Data Backup**: RTO/RPO targets, disaster recovery
- **Data Replication**: Multi-region replication, consistency models

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus, CloudWatch, Stackdriver
- **Log Aggregation**: ELK Stack, Splunk, Datadog
- **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger, X-Ray, Honeycomb
- **Alert Design**: Threshold-based and anomaly detection
- **Dashboard Design**: Key metrics visualization

### Security & Compliance
- **Network Security**: VPCs, security groups, firewalls
- **Access Control**: IAM, RBAC, service accounts
- **Encryption**: In-transit and at-rest encryption
- **Secrets Management**: Vault, AWS Secrets Manager
- **Compliance Frameworks**: GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA mappings

### Blockchain Infrastructure
- **Validator Infrastructure**: Running blockchain nodes
- **RPC Infrastructure**: High-availability RPC endpoints
- **Indexing**: Block explorers, subgraph indexers
- **Cross-Chain**: Bridge infrastructure, multi-chain deployment
- **Testnet Infrastructure**: Separate environments for testing

### Cost Management
- **Budget Tracking**: Cloud spend analysis
- **Resource Optimization**: Right-sizing instances
- **Commitment Discounts**: Reserved instances, savings plans
- **Spend Alerts**: Cost anomaly detection
- **Architecture Review**: Cost-effective alternative designs

### Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity
- **RTO/RPO Targets**: Recovery objectives
- **Backup Strategies**: Incremental, differential, full backups
- **Failover Automation**: Automated recovery procedures
- **Testing**: Regular disaster recovery drills
- **Documentation**: Runbooks and recovery procedures

## Best Practices
1. **Design for Failure**: Assume components will fail
2. **Automate Everything**: Infrastructure as code, GitOps
3. **Observe Deeply**: Comprehensive monitoring from day one
4. **Cost Awareness**: Optimize cost alongside performance
5. **Security First**: Security integrated throughout design
