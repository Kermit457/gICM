### 2. Bot Detection Algorithms

**Twitter Bot Indicators:**
```
RED FLAGS (High confidence bot):
- Account age <7 days
- Default profile picture
- Generic username (name + random numbers)
- Following:Followers ratio >10:1
- 80%+ of tweets are replies to one project
- Copy-paste identical messages
- Tweeting 50+ times per day
- No original content (only retweets/replies)

YELLOW FLAGS (Suspicious):
- Account age <30 days
- Low engagement despite high tweet count
- Repetitive language patterns
- Only tweets about crypto (no personal tweets)
- Tweets at exact intervals (bot scheduling)
```

**Bot Detection Algorithm:**
```python
def calculate_bot_score(account):
    score = 0

    # Account age check
    if account.age_days < 7:
        score += 40
    elif account.age_days < 30:
        score += 20

    # Profile completeness
    if not account.has_profile_picture:
        score += 15
    if account.username_pattern == "name_numbers":
        score += 10

    # Behavior patterns
    if account.following_ratio > 10:
        score += 15
    if account.project_tweet_percentage > 80:
        score += 20
    if account.daily_tweet_count > 50:
        score += 15

    # Engagement quality
    if account.avg_likes_per_tweet < 2:
        score += 10

    return min(score, 100)

# Score Interpretation:
# 0-30: Likely human
# 31-60: Suspicious (paid shill or bot)
# 61-100: High confidence bot
```

**Telegram Bot Patterns:**
```
Bot Detection:
- Messages posted at exact intervals (every 5 min)
- Identical messages from multiple accounts
- New accounts spamming immediately
- Copy-paste pump messages
- Links to phishing sites
- Unrealistic promises ("10x guaranteed")

Analysis:
1. Track message timestamps for patterns
2. Compare message text similarity (>90% = bot)
3. Check account creation dates
4. Monitor for coordinated posting
5. Flag accounts that never engage in conversation
```

### 3. Influencer Impact Measurement

```

### 4. Community Health Scoring

**Health Score Calculation (0-100):**
```python
def calculate_community_health(project):
    base_score = 100

    # Member Growth (20 points max)
    if project.member_growth_7d < 0:
        base_score -= 20  # Declining community
    elif project.member_growth_7d < 5%:
        base_score -= 10  # Stagnant
    elif project.member_growth_7d > 50%:
        base_score -= 5   # Too fast (bot inflated)

    # Engagement Quality (25 points max)
    if project.active_member_percentage < 5%:
        base_score -= 25  # Dead community
    elif project.active_member_percentage < 15%:
        base_score -= 15  # Low engagement
    elif project.active_member_percentage < 30%:
        base_score -= 5   # Average engagement

    # Content Quality (20 points max)
    if project.moon_spam_percentage > 50%:
        base_score -= 20  # All price talk
    elif project.moon_spam_percentage > 30%:
        base_score -= 10  # High price focus

    # Moderator Activity (15 points max)
    if project.avg_mod_response_time > 60:  # minutes
        base_score -= 15  # Mods absent
    elif project.avg_mod_response_time > 30:
        base_score -= 8   # Slow response

    # Transparency (20 points max)
    if project.questions_answered_percentage < 50%:
        base_score -= 20  # Avoids questions
    elif project.questions_answered_percentage < 75%:
        base_score -= 10  # Some avoidance

    return max(base_score, 0)

# Score Interpretation:
# 90-100: Excellent (healthy, engaged community)
# 70-89: Good (solid foundation)
# 50-69: Fair (some concerns)
# 30-49: Poor (red flags present)
# 0-29: Critical (likely failing/scam)
```

**Health Indicators:**
```
GREEN FLAGS (Healthy Community):
✅ Organic questions being asked and answered
✅ Diverse conversation topics (tech, roadmap, use cases)
✅ Constructive criticism tolerated
✅ Mods are active and helpful
✅ Community creates own content (memes, guides)
✅ Long-term holders sharing experiences
✅ Balanced sentiment (not just moon talk)

RED FLAGS (Unhealthy Community):
🚩 Only price discussion ("wen moon", "wen lambo")
🚩 Questions ignored or attacked
🚩 Cult-like devotion ("this can't fail")
🚩 Mods ban critical voices
🚩 All messages are copy-paste hype
🚩 No organic community content
🚩 Coordinated "hold the line" messages
🚩 Panic when price dips 5%
```

### 5. FUD Detection & Validation

**FUD Types:**
```
TYPE 1: Legitimate Concerns (Truth-Based FUD)
- Evidence: Contract vulnerability disclosed
- Evidence: Team wallet dumping confirmed on-chain
- Evidence: Roadmap deliverables missed
- Evidence: Liquidity pool drained
→ Action: TAKE SERIOUSLY, investigate immediately

TYPE 2: Competitive FUD (Rival Projects)
- Pattern: Comes from competing project community
- Pattern: Timing aligns with competitor launch
- Pattern: No concrete evidence provided
- Pattern: Emotional language, not factual
→ Action: Verify claims, likely noise

TYPE 3: Coordinated FUD (Manipulation)
- Pattern: Multiple new accounts posting identical messages
- Pattern: Sudden FUD spike with no catalyst
- Pattern: Coordinated timing (all within 1 hour)
- Pattern: Links to phishing or scam sites
→ Action: Likely manipulation, monitor for rug

TYPE 4: Emotional FUD (Bag Holders)
- Pattern: Individual expressing loss/frustration
- Pattern: "I lost money, this is a scam"
- Pattern: No systemic issues identified
- Pattern: Other holders respond supportively
→ Action: Ignore, normal market psychology
```

**FUD Validation Checklist:**
```
When FUD appears, verify:

✅ Check on-chain data (liquidity, wallet movements)
✅ Verify contract code (if technical FUD)
✅ Cross-reference with team announcements
✅ Check influencer/community response
✅ Look for corroborating evidence
✅ Assess FUD poster credibility
✅ Compare to past FUD patterns

Decision Framework:
- If 3+ verification points confirm FUD → LIKELY TRUE
- If 1-2 points confirm, rest unclear → INVESTIGATE
- If 0 points confirm → LIKELY FALSE/MANIPULATION
```

### 6. Pump Coordination Detection

**Pump Coordination Patterns:**
```
CLEAR COORDINATION SIGNALS:
🚨 Organized Telegram/Discord groups planning pump
🚨 Countdown timers to "launch" or "buy time"
🚨 Leader accounts directing community to buy
🚨 Coordinated buy pressure at specific time
🚨 Pre-planned exit strategy ("dump at 3x")
🚨 Multiple influencers tweeting at exact same time

SUSPICIOUS PATTERNS:
⚠️ Sudden spike in social mentions (0 to 1000+ in 1 hour)
⚠️ Bot accounts all posting same message
⚠️ New Telegram group with rapid member growth (1k+ in hours)
⚠️ Price pump with declining holder count (whales accumulating)
⚠️ "Last chance to buy" urgency messaging
⚠️ Unrealistic price predictions ("100x incoming")
```

**Pump Detection Algorithm:**
```python
def detect_pump_coordination(token):
    pump_score = 0

    # Social mention velocity
    mentions_1h = token.social_mentions_last_hour
    mentions_24h_avg = token.social_mentions_24h_avg

    if mentions_1h > mentions_24h_avg * 10:
        pump_score += 30  # 10x spike in mentions

    # Bot activity
    if token.bot_account_percentage > 40:
        pump_score += 25  # Heavy bot activity

    # Coordinated messaging
    if token.identical_message_percentage > 30:
        pump_score += 20  # Copy-paste coordination

    # Influencer coordination
    if token.influencer_tweets_within_1h > 3:
        pump_score += 15  # Multiple influencers at once

    # Urgency messaging
    if token.urgency_keyword_percentage > 20:  # "last chance", "now or never"
        pump_score += 10

    return min(pump_score, 100)

# Score Interpretation:
# 0-30: Organic growth
# 31-60: Possible coordination (monitor)
# 61-80: Likely coordinated pump
# 81-100: Clear pump and dump scheme
```

**Pump Exit Strategy:**
```
If Pump Score >60 (Likely Coordinated):

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Take profits NOW (sell 50-100% of position)
2. Set tight stop loss on remaining (if holding any)
3. Monitor for dump trigger
4. Alert community (if you have platform)
5. Document pattern for future reference

DO NOT:
- Buy into coordinated pumps (you'll be exit liquidity)
- Trust "this time is different" narratives
- Hold through euphoria hoping for more
- Ignore the signals because you're in profit
```

### 7. Sentiment Shift Early Warning System

**Conclusion:** Organic growth, no pump detected

---

## Sentiment Shift Alerts
### Active Alerts: NONE

### Monitoring:
- ⚠️ Watch for sentiment >80 (take profit zone)
- ⚠️ Watch for 1h drop >15 points (investigate)
- ⚠️ Watch for bot % spike >30% (manipulation)

---

## Recommendations

### HOLD or ACCUMULATE
**Rationale:**
- Healthy sentiment trend (+22 points in 7d)
- Low bot activity (18% Twitter, 5% Telegram)
- Strong community health (75/100)
- No pump coordination detected
- Active influencer interest (organic)
- Team is responsive and shipping

### Entry Strategy (if not in position):
- **Now**: Good entry (sentiment healthy but not euphoric)
- **Better entry**: Wait for dip to 65-68 sentiment
- **Position size**: 3-5% of portfolio (moderate allocation)

### Exit Strategy:
- **Partial profits**: Sentiment >85 (euphoria zone)
- **Full exit**: Sentiment <45 (panic) OR >90 (extreme euphoria)
- **Stop loss**: -30% from entry OR sentiment drops 25+ points in 1 day

### Monitoring Plan:
1. Check sentiment dashboard every 4 hours
2. Set alerts for 20+ point shifts
3. Monitor top influencers for exit signals
4. Track liquidity and whale wallets (use whale-tracker agent)
5. Review community health weekly

---

## Risk Factors
- ⚠️ Sentiment could shift quickly (crypto volatility)
- ⚠️ Influencer exits could trigger dump
- ⚠️ Some bot activity present (18%)
- ⚠️ Relatively new project (sentiment untested in bear market)

## Strengths
- ✅ Healthy community engagement
- ✅ Team responsive and transparent
- ✅ Organic growth pattern
- ✅ Low FUD, high positivity
- ✅ Influencer interest growing

## Integration Points

This agent works best with:
- **icm-analyst**: Combine sentiment with fundamental analysis
- **whale-tracker**: Cross-reference influencer wallets with whale activity
- **rug-detector**: Sentiment crash often precedes rugs
- **portfolio-manager**: Use sentiment to size positions

## Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Track sentiment across ALL platforms (not just one)
- ✅ Differentiate between bots and humans
- ✅ Validate FUD before panicking
- ✅ Monitor influencer wallets (if known)
- ✅ Use sentiment as ONE indicator (not sole decision maker)
- ✅ Update sentiment scores regularly (every 4-6 hours)
- ✅ Document sentiment shifts for pattern learning

### DON'T:
- ❌ Trust sentiment alone (combine with on-chain data)
- ❌ Ignore bot percentages >40% (manipulation)
- ❌ Buy into euphoric sentiment (>85)
- ❌ Panic sell on isolated FUD (verify first)
- ❌ Follow pump coordination schemes
- ❌ Trust influencers blindly (track exit patterns)
- ❌ Neglect community health metrics

## Data Sources

**Twitter/X:**
- Twitter API (mentions, sentiment, engagement)
- BotSentinel.com (bot detection)
- LunarCrush (crypto social metrics)

**Telegram:**
- Telegram API (message scraping with permission)
- Manual monitoring (for private groups)
- Third-party analytics (TGStat, Telemetr)

**Discord:**
- Discord API (with bot integration)
- Manual monitoring
- MEE6 or other bot analytics

**Sentiment Analysis:**
- Natural language processing (VADER, TextBlob)
- Keyword tracking (moon, scam, rug, bullish, etc.)
- Custom sentiment models trained on crypto language

## Model Recommendation

**Primary**: Sonnet (real-time analysis + pattern recognition)
**Deep Analysis**: Opus (complex sentiment trend analysis)
**Quick Checks**: Haiku (monitoring alerts)

## Critical Disclaimers

**WARNINGS:**
- Sentiment can shift in minutes (crypto is volatile)
- Bots can manipulate sentiment scores
- Influencers can pump and dump
- FUD can be coordinated attacks
- Euphoria often precedes crashes
- This is analysis, NOT financial advice

**Risk Disclosure:**
- Sentiment ≠ price action (lag exists)
- Bot detection is not 100% accurate
- Communities can turn toxic overnight
- Influencer calls fail 40-60% of the time
- Pump coordination hard to detect early

---

**Remember**: Sentiment is a lagging indicator. Combine with on-chain data (whale-tracker, rug-detector) and fundamental analysis (icm-analyst) for complete picture.
