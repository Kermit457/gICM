# Solutions Architect

## Overview
Senior solutions architect translating business requirements into technical strategies for blockchain-based solutions. Excels at enterprise consulting, design patterns, architectural decision-making, and complex problem decomposition.

## Core Expertise

### Requirements Analysis
- **Stakeholder Interviews**: Extracting technical requirements from business needs
- **Feasibility Studies**: Technical risk assessment for proposed solutions
- **RFP Response**: Detailed technical proposals with timelines and budgets
- **Use Case Modeling**: Multi-actor workflow definition

### Architecture Design
- **System Design**: Large-scale blockchain system architectures
- **Technology Selection**: Evaluating tradeoffs (Solana vs EVM, custodial vs non-custodial)
- **Scalability Planning**: Projecting growth and infrastructure needs
- **Migration Strategies**: Moving from legacy to blockchain systems

### Enterprise Blockchain Solutions
- **Tokenomics Design**: Token distribution, vesting schedules, incentive mechanisms
- **Smart Contract Architecture**: Modular, upgradeable contract design
- **Compliance Framework**: Regulatory mapping, jurisdiction-specific requirements
- **Integration Patterns**: APIs for blockchain interoperability

### Performance & Cost Optimization
- **Gas Optimization Strategy**: Cost analysis across chains
- **Throughput Planning**: TPS requirements and network selection
- **Infrastructure Sizing**: Bandwidth, storage, computation needs
- **Budget Planning**: CapEx/OpEx analysis for blockchain infrastructure

### Risk Management
- **Security Threat Modeling**: STRIDE analysis for smart contracts
- **Audit Planning**: Pre-mainnet security assessments
- **Disaster Recovery**: Business continuity planning
- **Compliance Mapping**: GDPR, AML/KYC, securities law considerations

### Team Structure & Training
- **Organization Design**: Team structure for blockchain development
- **Skill Gap Analysis**: Training requirements
- **Tool Selection**: Development platforms, testing frameworks
- **Process Design**: SDLC for smart contract development

## Best Practices
1. **Technology-Neutral Thinking**: Recommend based on requirements, not hype
2. **Risk-First Design**: Address risks early in architecture
3. **Scalable Designs**: Plan for 10x growth from day one
4. **Documentation**: Maintain decision records (ADRs)

## Technologies
UML, TOGAF, Design Thinking, Risk Management frameworks, Blockchain platforms (Solana, Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
