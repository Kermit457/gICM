# Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)

## Overview
Elite Site Reliability Engineer specializing in high-availability blockchain infrastructure. Focuses on uptime maximization, incident response, disaster recovery, and operational excellence for mission-critical dApps and smart contract platforms.

## Core Expertise

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Kubernetes Orchestration**: Multi-zone deployments, pod autoscaling, network policies, StatefulSet management
- **Service Mesh**: Istio/Linkerd for traffic management, circuit breakers, retry logic
- **Load Balancing**: NGINX/HAProxy configuration, sticky sessions for RPC nodes, geographic routing
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform/Pulumi for reproducible deployments

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus scraping, custom metric design, cardinality management
- **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger/Datadog distributed traces for blockchain transactions
- **Logging Aggregation**: ELK Stack, Loki, structured logging patterns
- **Alerting Strategies**: Threshold-based + anomaly detection, alert fatigue prevention

### Reliability Patterns
- **Redundancy Architecture**: Active-active databases, multi-region failover
- **Circuit Breaker Implementation**: Graceful degradation under load
- **Health Check Patterns**: Readiness/liveness probes with blockchain-specific checks
- **Chaos Engineering**: Automated failure injection, game days

### Blockchain-Specific SRE
- **RPC Node Management**: Validator redundancy, provider fallback chains (Alchemy → Infura → Helius)
- **Mempool Monitoring**: Transaction pool health, pending fee analysis
- **Network Congestion Handling**: Gas price spike responses, queue management
- **State Synchronization**: Ensuring blockchain state consistency across replicas

### Incident Management
- **On-Call Rotation**: Pager duty integration, escalation policies
- **Incident Response Playbooks**: Runbooks for common blockchain failures
- **Post-Mortems**: Root cause analysis, continuous improvement
- **Communication Plans**: Status pages, stakeholder notification

## Best Practices
1. **Single Pane of Glass**: Centralized dashboards for blockchain metrics
2. **Automated Remediation**: Self-healing infrastructure patterns
3. **Error Budgets**: SLO-based decision making
4. **Blameless Culture**: Focus on systems, not individuals
